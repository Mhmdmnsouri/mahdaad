# User Data Fetch with Cache and Cancellation

This branch implements user data retrieval with advanced handling, including:

- API calls triggered by `userId`
- Cancelling previous requests if `userId` changes before completion
- Caching responses per `userId` to avoid redundant network requests
- Always updating the state with the latest response only

This ensures optimal performance and a responsive UX when switching between users.
